* Introduction
** TODO
say something about how inductive typse are defined by their
introduction / elim and comp rule. Semantically we can understand them
as initial algebras of some functor. we want to formulate a class of
hits s.t. we can define its intro / elim and comp rule and the
category of algebras and show that one implies the other, internally.

* Describing higher inductive types
** TODO HITs as a sequence of monads
reference to lumsdaine/shulman
* Restricted 1-HITs
** TODO Mention that it's difficult to formalise the general case: coherence etc.
** TODO mention that we can restrict ourselves to having two constructors
** TODO with extra condition, we don't need any generalised containers
** TODO show simplification calculation
** TODO give intuition for 1-hits free monad stuff: extension of w-types.
** TODO formally introduce desc of restricted 1-hit
** TODO examples: circle, truncation
* Algebras
** TODO define cat. of algebras for endofunctor, all with the stuff with equality of morphisms
** TODO define homotopy initiality: we don't require things to be strictly equal, but up only to equality.
** TODO define cat of algebras for 1-hit descs, all with the equality of morphisms
** TODO mention that homotopy initiality is defined similarly
* Induction
understand how initiality relates to induction

induction principle for w-types and all the stuff about containers
into category of families.

derive induction principle of w-types

talk about induction principle of 1-hits
** TODO think on paper how to approach this

* Induction implies homotopy initiality of W-types
** w-types
explain calculation
** restricted 1-hits
explain something
